         <br><h1>The Historical Commitment To The Waugh-Watkins Scholarship Fund.</h1><br><hr> <h4>
        
        In June, 1996, under the leadership of then President Reggie Watkins a bold idea was embraced by the Waugh Watkins Family Reunion Board. The Board implemented a Scholarship committee, and established guidelines to create a process for awarding annual educational scholarships to eligible family members.</h4><hr>
        <h3>Original Scholarship committee members:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Virginia “Peggye” Dowell (Chairwoman)</li>
            <li>Cathy Dowell-Vickers</li>
            <li>Henry Vickers, Jr.</li>
            <li>Marshall Whitley</li>
            <li>Myron Dowell</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>The five family members were charged with adopting a recommended set of guidelines and by-laws that were unanimously adopted by the reunion board on August 1, 1996 in Seattle, Washington.</h4>
        <h4>The guidelines were ratified at the reunion’s general meeting on August 3, 1996 establishing the Waugh-Watkins Scholarship Fund.</h4>
        <h4>The mission was to award the first scholarship at the 1998 family reunion in N. Wilkesboro, North Carolina.</h4>
        <hr><br>
        <h2>On July 6, 1998, Amber Brewington became the first recipient of a Waugh-Watkins Scholarship.</h2>
        <br><hr>
        <h4> Since 1996 the goal of the Waugh-Watkins Scholarship Fund has been to honor our heritage, ancestors and family legacy by awarding scholarships that will help ensure higher education for our children and grandchildren for generations to come.</h4><h4>The founders of the Fund based their vision on the initiative to build a legacy which would make every family member proud.</h4>
        <hr><br>
        <h2> We can all rejoice that after more than 20 years our family continues to achieve this goal!</h2>
        <br><hr>
        <h4>Since its inception the committee has awarded over <strong><span style="color: rgb(199, 11, 11);">$20,000</span></strong> in scholarships, for tuition and books to 39 very deserving Waugh-Watkins descendants.<br>
        Let’s strive for 100% participation from every family member.</h4>
        <hr><br><h2>Help demonstrate to the world a strong belief in and strong support of the Waugh-Watkins progeny.</h2><br><hr>
        
        <h4>If you have not made your contribution to the Waugh-Watkins Scholarship Fund, we ask that you do so now. Let’s keep the vision alive so we may continue to help our descendants with the support needed to successfully undertake meaningful educational opportunities and pass the Waugh-Watkins baton to the next generation.</h4>
        <h3>Thank you.</h3>
